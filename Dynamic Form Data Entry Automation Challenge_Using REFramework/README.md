The primary objective of this UiPath **RPA Challenge** is to design a dynamic workflow using **REFramework** capable of efficiently inputting data from a spreadsheet into form fields on a changing screen layout. 
The challenge spans across 10 rounds, with the form fields shifting positions after each submission. 
The participants must devise a robust solution that adapts to these changes and accurately identifies the correct input locations for every spreadsheet record.

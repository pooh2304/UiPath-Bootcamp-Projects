# Project Overview

This UiPath project automates the extraction of crucial information from **1000 individual PDF invoices**. 
The bot systematically opens each invoice, scrapes key fields—invoice number, dates, company name, and total amount—and records the data in an Excel spreadsheet. 
It efficiently manages errors by logging successful and failed transactions, subsequently organizing the invoices into corresponding folders for successful and unsuccessful extractions. 
This robust automation streamlines the data extraction process, enhances accuracy, and provides a structured record of successful and unsuccessful transactions for further analysis and troubleshooting.

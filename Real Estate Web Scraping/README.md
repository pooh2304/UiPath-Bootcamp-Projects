# Project Overview

The objective of this UiPath project is to create an efficient RPA robot capable of scraping detailed property information (price, bedrooms, bathrooms, area, and address) from up to **500 listings** on **Zillow.com** for a specified location. 
The extracted data will be intelligently organized, filtered, and sorted based on user-defined criteria, and the final results will be seamlessly integrated into an Excel file named output.xlsx for easy analysis and reference.

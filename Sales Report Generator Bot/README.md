# Project Overview

The Sales Report Generator Bot improves the efficiency of the sales reporting workflow. In this automated process, raw data is extracted from an Excel file, and a detailed sales report is first created in Word format using an existing template. Subsequently, the generated report is converted into a standardized PDF format using a Windows application, and then the files are systematically organized and moved to a specified folder.
